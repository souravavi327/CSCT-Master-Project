Privacy Risk Monitoring Dashboard for Small Healthcare Clinics

Project Overview
This project addresses the "monitoring gap" in small UK healthcare clinics that lack the resources for expensive security tools. It features a functional Power BI Dashboard designed to help non-technical managers detect internal data privacy risks, such as unauthorized "snooping" or credential misuse.

Key Features
1. Statistical Anomaly Detection: Utilizes Z-score analysis to automatically flag users whose access volume significantly exceeds their role-based average.
2. Temporal Risk Analysis: A high-density heatmap identifies suspicious access events during off-hours or early morning spikes.
3. Sensitivity-Aware Monitoring: Maps data sensitivity levels against user roles to highlight potential policy violations regarding High-Sensitivity records.
4. Low-Code Architecture: Built using Microsoft Power BI and a star-schema data model for high performance and cost-effectiveness.

Repository Contents
1. Dashboard.pbix: The primary Power BI artifact containing the visualizations and DAX measures.
2. avi.py: The Python script used to generate the synthetic data. It utilizes the Pandas and Faker libraries to create realistic clinical access logs.
3. privacy_risk_monitoring_dataset.csv: The synthetic dataset containing over 200,000 clinical access logs used for testing (generated by 'avi.py').
4. README.md: Project documentation.

Tools Used
1. Microsoft Power BI: Dashboard development and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
2. Python (Pandas & Faker): Implemented in 'avi.py' to generate the high-volume synthetic clinical dataset.
